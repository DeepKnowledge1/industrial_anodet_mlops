## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AnomaVision AI MLOps pipeline on your local machine and deploy it to Azure.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository, ensuring you also initialize and update the Git submodules, which are crucial for the `AnomaVision` library:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DeepKnowledge1/industrial_anodet_mlops
cd anomavision
```

*Note: Replace `https://github.com/DeepKnowledge1/industrial_anodet_mlops` with the actual URL of your repository.*

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses `poetry` for dependency management. Install the required packages by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

### 3. Train Your Model

The `train.py` script is designed to train the anomaly detection models. It requires specifying the dataset path and the backbone network. Ensure your dataset is accessible (e.g., at `D:/01-DATA/bottle` or a similar path on your system).

```bash
python src/train.py --dataset_path "path/to/your/dataset" --backbone resnet18
```

**Key Parameters for `train.py`:**

- `--dataset_path`: **(Required)** Path to the dataset folder containing `train/good` images (e.g., `D:/01-DATA/bottle`).
- `--backbone`: **(Optional)** Backbone network for feature extraction. Choose between `resnet18` (default) or `wide_resnet50`.
- `--model_data_path`: **(Optional)** Directory to save model distributions and ONNX file (default: `./distributions/`).
- `--output_model`: **(Optional)** Output folder for model export (default: `model_output`).
- `--batch_size`: **(Optional)** Batch size for training and inference (default: `2`).
- `--layer_indices`: **(Optional)** List of layer indices to extract features from (default: `[0]`).
- `--feat_dim`: **(Optional)** Number of random feature dimensions to keep (default: `50`).
- `--mlflow_tracking_uri`: **(Optional)** MLflow tracking URI (default: `file:./mlruns`).
- `--mlflow_experiment_name`: **(Optional)** MLflow experiment name (default: `padim_anomaly_detection`).
- `--run_name`: **(Optional)** MLflow run name. If not provided, it will be auto-generated.
- `--registered_model_name`: **(Optional)** Name for the registered model in MLflow Model Registry (default: `PadimONNX`).
- `--test_dataset_path`: **(Optional)** Path to test dataset for evaluation. If not provided, it will use `dataset_path`.
- `--evaluate_model`: **(Flag)** Include this flag to evaluate the model after training.

### 4. Run FastAPI Inference Server

To run the FastAPI application locally:

```bash
uvicorn src/fastapi_app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

This will start the FastAPI server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 5. Run Streamlit Application

To connect the Streamlit frontend with your running FastAPI backend:

```bash
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501 --server.enableCORS true --server.enableXsrfProtection false
```

Access the Streamlit application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 6. Test `score.py`

The `score.py` file is critical for model inference within Azure ML deployments. It's essential to test its functionality thoroughly before deployment.

To run the unit tests for `score.py` (assuming `test_padim.py` is an example of such a test, located in `tests/`):

```bash
pytest tests/test_padim.py
```

*Note: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before running tests.*

### 7. Build and Tag Docker Image

To containerize your FastAPI application, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.np -t fastapi-anomavision:latest .
```

Then, tag the image for your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry):

```bash
docker tag fastapi-anomavision:latest deepknowledge/fastapi-anomavision:latest
```

### 8. Deploy to AKS

For full deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) via Azure ML, follow the instructions in the `deployment/` and `pipelines/` directories. A typical deployment command would look like:

```bash
az ml online-deployment create -n my-deployment --endpoint my-endpoint --file deployment/endpoint-k8s-config.yml
```
